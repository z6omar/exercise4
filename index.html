  <h1>Major-General's Song</h1>
  <h2>Gilbert &amp; Sullivan (1879)</h2>

  <p>I am the very model of a modern Major-General,<br>
  I've information vegetable, animal, and mineral,<br>
  I know the kings of England, and I quote the fights historical,<br>
  From Marathon to Waterloo, in order categorical;<br>
  I'm very well acquainted too with matters mathematical,<br>
  I understand equations, both the simple and quadratical,<br>
  About binomial theorem I'm teeming with a lot o' news---<br>
  With many cheerful facts about the square of the hypotenuse.</p>

  <p>I'm very good at integral and differential calculus;<br>
  I know the scientific names of beings animalculous:<br>
  In short, in matters vegetable, animal, and mineral,<br>
  I am the very model of a modern Major-Gineral.</p>

  <p>I know our mythic history, King Arthur's and Sir Caradoc's;<br>
  I answer hard acrostics, I've a pretty taste for paradox,<br>
  I quote in elegiacs all the crimes of Heliogabalus,<br>
  In conics I can floor peculiarities parabolous;<br>
  I can tell undoubted Raphaels from Gerard Dows and Zoffanies,<br>
  I know the croaking chorus from The Frogs of Aristophanes!<br>
  Then I can hum a fugue of which I've heard the music's din afore,<br>
  And whistle all the airs from that infernal nonsense Pinafore.</p>

  <p>Then I can write a washing bill in Babylonic cuneiform,<br>
  And tell you ev'ry detail of Caractacus's uniform:<br>
  In short, in matters vegetable, animal, and mineral,<br>
  I am the very model of a modern Major-Gineral.</p>

  <p>In fact, when I know what is meant by "mamelon" and "ravelin",<br>
  When I can tell at sight a Mauser rifle from a javelin,<br>
  When such affairs as sorties and surprises I'm more wary at,<br>
  And when I know precisely what is meant by "commissariat",<br>
  When I have learnt what progress has been made in modern gunnery,<br>
  When I know more of tactics than a novice in a nunnery –<br>
  In short, when I've a smattering of elemental strategy –<br>
  You'll say a better Major-General has never sat a gee.</p>

  <p>For my military knowledge, though I'm plucky and adventury,<br>
  Has only been brought down to the beginning of the century;<br>
  But still, in matters vegetable, animal, and mineral,<br>
  I am the very model of a modern Major-Gineral.</p>
